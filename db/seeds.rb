I can't guarantee you that we already have a lot in common - but if you read on and find out we do - you should message me! \n I want someone who will be upfront, honest, and I will do the same. \n It would be nice to have someone who would enjoy exploring London and of course trying out local eateries. There's nothing like a good dinner and then going for a walk with a great companion at sunset! I understand that being together is the most important part of a relationship no matter what we are doing (besides communication, of course). \n I'm now looking for a relationship, but I'm not looking to jump into anything without getting to know someone first. I've never been married, so I'm pretty sure it won't kill me to take things slow and make sure we are compatible. \n Anyways I think I wrote enough for now.

My career began on the Off-Broadway stage and then in television in the 1980s, most notably as David Addison in Moonlighting (1985Ã¢â‚¬â€œ89) and has continued both in television and film since, including comedic, dramatic, and action roles.I'm probably best known for my role of John McClane in the Die Hard series, which were mostly critical and uniformly financial successes. In fact, the movies I'm in have grossed about $3b in the North American box office alone.",
